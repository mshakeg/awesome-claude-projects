# Solidity Documentation Best Practices

## General Guidelines

1. Be concise yet informative
2. Use consistent terminology throughout the codebase
3. Document all public and external functions
4. Explain complex algorithms or business logic
5. Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## Code-Level Documentation

- Use inline comments for complex code sections
- Explain the "why" behind important decisions
- Document any assumptions or preconditions

## Contract-Level Documentation

- Provide an overview of the contract's purpose and functionality
- List any dependencies or inherited contracts
- Explain the contract's role within the larger system

## Security Considerations

- Document any potential security risks or considerations
- Explain access control mechanisms
- Note any critical state changes or value transfers

## Improving Existing Comments

When enhancing existing documentation:

1. Identify unclear or outdated comments
2. Provide more context where necessary
3. Break down complex explanations into smaller, digestible parts
4. Ensure comments align with current code functionality
5. Add missing information, especially for edge cases or important assumptions

Example of improving a comment:

Before:
```solidity
// Calculate reward
uint256 reward = stake * rate;
```

After:
```solidity
// Calculate user reward based on stake and current rate
// Note: This assumes rate is always > 0 and < 100
uint256 reward = stake * rate / 100;
```

## State Variable Documentation

Document state variables, especially public ones, using NatSpec comments:

```solidity
/// @notice The minimum stake required to participate
/// @dev This value is set at deployment and cannot be changed
uint256 public constant MIN_STAKE = 100 ether;
```

## Event Documentation

Document events to explain when they're emitted and what their parameters represent:

```solidity
/// @notice Emitted when a new proposal is created
/// @param proposalId The unique identifier of the proposal
/// @param proposer The address that created the proposal
/// @param description A brief description of the proposal
event ProposalCreated(uint256 indexed proposalId, address indexed proposer, string description);
```

## Modifier Documentation

Document function modifiers to explain their purpose and any side effects:

```solidity
/// @notice Requires the caller to have the admin role
/// @dev Reverts if the caller is not an admin
modifier onlyAdmin() {
    require(hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender), "Caller is not an admin");
    _;
}
```

## Version and Compatibility Notes

Include information about Solidity version requirements and any known compatibility issues:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/// @title Token Swap Router
/// @notice Provides functions for swapping tokens
/// @dev Requires Solidity 0.8.0 or higher
/// @custom:security-contact security@example.com
contract TokenSwapRouter {
    // Contract implementation
}
```

## Grouping Related Functions

Use comments to group related functions for better code organization:

```solidity
// --- Token Management Functions ---

function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    // Implementation
}

function burn(address from, uint256 amount) external {
    // Implementation
}

// --- Governance Functions ---

function propose(bytes calldata data) external {
    // Implementation
}

function vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external {
    // Implementation
}
```
