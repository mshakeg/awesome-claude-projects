# Branching Tree Technique (BTT) Overview

The Branching Tree Technique is a systematic approach to testing Solidity smart contracts, focusing on thoroughly examining all possible execution paths of a function.

## Core Principles

1. Create a .tree file for each function under test
2. Hierarchically structure all possible execution paths
3. Use "given" for contract states and "when" for function parameters
4. Conclude branches with "it should" statements for expected outcomes
5. Translate .tree structures into comprehensive test contracts

## Benefits of BTT

- Ensures comprehensive test coverage
- Provides clear visualization of all execution paths
- Facilitates easier identification of edge cases
- Improves code quality and reliability
- Offers a structured approach to test case generation

## Limitations of BTT

- Can be time-consuming for highly complex functions
- Requires careful maintenance as contract functionality evolves
- May result in a large number of test cases for functions with many branches

## When to Use BTT

BTT is particularly useful for:
- Complex smart contracts with multiple execution paths
- Functions with critical security implications
- Contracts handling significant value or sensitive operations
- Projects requiring extremely high test coverage and reliability

When implementing BTT, focus on creating comprehensive .tree files and translating them into well-structured, maintainable test contracts.

## BTT in Practice

The Branching Tree Technique has been successfully implemented in real-world projects. A notable example is Sablier v2, which pioneered the use of BTT:

- [Sablier v2-core](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core)
- [Sablier v2-periphery](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery)

These projects demonstrate the effectiveness of BTT in complex smart contract systems, showcasing how it can be applied to ensure comprehensive test coverage and maintain high code quality standards.
