# Branching Tree Technique (BTT) Overview

The Branching Tree Technique is a systematic approach to testing Solidity smart contracts, focusing on thoroughly examining all possible execution paths of a function.

## Core Principles

1. Create a .tree file for each function under test
2. Hierarchically structure all possible execution paths
3. Use "given" for contract states and "when" for function parameters
4. Conclude branches with "it should" statements for expected outcomes
5. Translate .tree structures into comprehensive test contracts

## Key Features of BTT

- Exhaustive Condition Checking: Consider all possible states, inputs, and their combinations
- Hierarchical Structuring: Organize conditions from most general to most specific
- Consistent Terminology: Use "when" for input parameters and "given" for state conditions
- Extreme Granularity: Break down complex scenarios into multiple levels of conditions
- Comprehensive Edge Case Coverage: Include all possible edge cases and error conditions

## Benefits of BTT

- Ensures comprehensive test coverage
- Provides clear visualization of all execution paths
- Facilitates easier identification of edge cases
- Improves code quality and reliability
- Offers a structured approach to test case generation

## Limitations of BTT

- Can be time-consuming for highly complex functions
- Requires careful maintenance as contract functionality evolves
- May result in a large number of test cases for functions with many branches

## When to Use BTT

BTT is particularly useful for:
- Complex smart contracts with multiple execution paths
- Functions with critical security implications
- Contracts handling significant value or sensitive operations
- Projects requiring extremely high test coverage and reliability

When implementing BTT, focus on creating comprehensive .tree files and translating them into well-structured, maintainable test contracts.

## BTT in Practice

The Branching Tree Technique has been successfully implemented in real-world projects. A notable example is Sablier v2, which pioneered the use of BTT:

- [Sablier v2-core](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core)
- [Sablier v2-periphery](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery)

## Best Practices for BTT Implementation

1. Start with the most general conditions (e.g., delegate call checks) and progressively add more specific conditions
2. Consider all possible types of callers and their permissions
3. Include time-based conditions where relevant
4. Consider all possible states of the contract and related entities (e.g., stream states in Sablier)
5. Go into detail about complex operations like hook executions, including potential reentrancy scenarios
6. Use consistent formatting throughout the .tree file
7. Include specific actions in the leaf nodes (e.g., "it should mark the stream as depleted" instead of just "it should update state")
8. Regularly review and update .tree files to ensure all possible execution paths are covered
9. Balance comprehensiveness with maintainability when dealing with highly complex functions

## Validating BTT Structures

1. Peer review .tree files to catch missing scenarios or inconsistencies
2. Cross-reference .tree files with contract code to ensure all conditions are accounted for
3. Periodically audit .tree files as contract functionality evolves
4. Use automated tools to validate the structure and completeness of .tree files when possible

By following these principles and best practices, BTT can provide a robust framework for ensuring comprehensive test coverage and maintaining high code quality standards in complex smart contract systems.
